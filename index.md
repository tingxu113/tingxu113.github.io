## About Me

I'm currently working toward the Ph.D. degree (advised by [Prof. Ting-Zhu Huang](https://www.math.uestc.edu.cn/info/1081/2041.htm) and [Prof. Liang-Jian Deng](https://liangjiandeng.github.io/)) in mathematics with the School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.

Before that, I received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from the [Yunnan University](https://www.ynu.edu.cn), Kunming, Yunnan, China.
In 2016 and 2017, I was a Joint-Training B.S. student in [Fudan University](https://www.fdu.edu.cn).
 
My research interest is mainly focusing on **image fusion**.
