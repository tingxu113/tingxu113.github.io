## About Me

I'm currently working toward the Ph.D. degree (advised by [Prof. Ting-Zhu Huang](https://www.math.uestc.edu.cn/info/1081/2041.htm) and [Prof. Liang-Jian Deng](https://liangjiandeng.github.io/)) in mathematics with the School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China.

Before that, I received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from [the Mianyang Teachersâ€™ College](https://www.mtc.edu.cn/), Mianyang, China.
 
My research interest is mainly focusing on **image fusion** and **hyperspectral super-resolution**.
